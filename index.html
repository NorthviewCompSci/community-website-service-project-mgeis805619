                <h2>What is melting pot club?</h2>
                <p>The melting pot club is a club where one can learn about different cultures 
                    and try different foods from that culture. One or twice a month we have a meeting
                where we choose an event from a culture we have not done before. First we talk about the event and
            the culture, then we try foods that are custom to that event.</p>
                <h2>Why is this important?</h2>
                <p>It is very important to know and learn about other cultures. There are many cultures that you may 
                    not know about but with melting pot it gives you the oppertunity to learn about them and you may 
                just learn something you didn't know/find a culture that you find interesting.</p>
